A collection of my Alfred Workflows

## Screenshot OCR [v1.0.0](https://github.com/ethanleet/alfred-workflows/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

### Select a region of your screen -> take a screenshot -> text is copied to your clipboard!

This is a super simple workflow utilizing macOS' native text recognition engine, same as the one used in the Live Text feature. There is no more need to purchase 3rd-party apps for this convenient feature (except that you still need an Alfred Powerpack to access Workflows).

### Languages supported
- en-US: (English as used in the United States)
- de-DE: (German as used in Germany)
- fr-FR: (French as used in France)
- it-IT: (Italian as used in Italy)
- es-ES: (Spanish as used in Spain)
- pt-BR: (Portuguese as used in Brazil)
- ko-KR: (Korean as used in South Korea)
- uk-UA: (Ukrainian as used in Ukraine)
- ja-JA: (Japanese as used in Japan)
- ru-RU: (Russian as used in Russia)
- yue-Hant: (Traditional Cantonese)
- yue-Hans: (Simplified Cantonese)
- zh-Hant: (Traditional Chinese)
- zh-Hans: (Simplified Chinese)

There is no config to this workflow: all supported languages are auto-detected.
